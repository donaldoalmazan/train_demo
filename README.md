# Train Bogie Counter, Object Tracking & Counting Demo

This project demonstrates a **train bogie (wheel assembly) detection and counting application** that runs locally on a Raspberry Pi 5B 8GB. 


To run the code:

Navigate to the project folder (~/dev/train_demo/) and run the following code

```bash
python bogie_counter_yolo.py


## Background

This project uses [Ultralytics YOLO](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) and [ByteTrack](https://github.com/ifzhang/ByteTrack) tracking libraries.  

This prototype runs was created using a model train set and is designed to scale up for real-world train monitoring.
